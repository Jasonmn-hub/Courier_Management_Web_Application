# Windows Startup Fix

## The Problem
Your installer setup everything correctly ✅, but the startup fails because of this line in package.json:
```
"dev": "NODE_ENV=development npx tsx server/index.ts"
```

`NODE_ENV=development` doesn't work on Windows Command Prompt.

## ✅ QUICK SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Use the Batch File (Easiest)
I created `start_application_windows.bat` for you. Just double-click it to start the application.

### Option 2: Manual Command (Simple)
Open Command Prompt in your project folder and run:
```cmd
npx tsx server/index.ts
```

The `.env` file your installer created already has all the environment variables, so you don't need to set NODE_ENV.

### Option 3: Fix package.json (Permanent)
Install cross-env to make commands work on both Windows and Unix:
```cmd
npm install --save-dev cross-env
```

Then update package.json scripts to:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development npx tsx server/index.ts",
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

## Test It Works
After using any solution above, your application should start and show:
```
24-hour reminder email system initialized - checking every 2 hours
Database seeded successfully!
7:XX:XX AM [express] serving on port 5000
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

## Your Setup Status ✅
From your logs, everything else is working perfectly:
- ✅ Node.js v22.19.0 installed  
- ✅ PostgreSQL 17.5 connected
- ✅ Database `courier_cms` created with all tables
- ✅ npm dependencies installed
- ✅ .env file created with DATABASE_URL

Only the startup command syntax needed fixing!
