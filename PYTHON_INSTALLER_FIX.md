# Python Installer Fix for Windows

## The Problem ❌

Your installer command fails:
```
npx tsx -r dotenv/config server/index.ts
```

**Error**: `Cannot find module 'dotenv/config'`

## The Solution ✅

Change the startup command in your Python installer from:
```python
# BROKEN - Don't use this
subprocess.run(["npx", "tsx", "-r", "dotenv/config", "server/index.ts"])
```

To:
```python
# WORKING - Use this instead
subprocess.run(["npx", "tsx", "server/index.ts"])
```

## Why This Works

1. ✅ Your `.env` file is already created with DATABASE_URL
2. ✅ The application loads environment variables automatically
3. ✅ No need for the `-r dotenv/config` flag
4. ✅ Simple `npx tsx server/index.ts` command works

## Alternative Windows Commands

If you want to be extra sure, use:
```python
# Option 1: Simple tsx command
["npx", "tsx", "server/index.ts"]

# Option 2: With explicit env file (if needed)
["npx", "tsx", "--env-file=.env", "server/index.ts"]

# Option 3: Use npm script instead
["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

## Quick Test

To verify your setup works, manually run:
```cmd
npx tsx server/index.ts
```

You should see:
```
24-hour reminder email system initialized - checking every 2 hours
Database seeded successfully!
X:XX:XX AM [express] serving on port 5000
```

## Your Current Status ✅

Everything else in your installer is working perfectly:
- ✅ PostgreSQL connected
- ✅ Database `courier_cms` created with all tables  
- ✅ npm dependencies installed
- ✅ .env file created with proper DATABASE_URL

Only the startup test command needs this simple fix!
